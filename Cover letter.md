## Cover letter

I have been a full stack web developer for the past 14 years, building websites, developing applications and providing internet services for businesses as an independent contractor. Almost all of my projects are all still online and doing well. I've worked with different teams, from tiny start-ups to governmental organisations and large corporations, so I know how to adapt and scale. I've been the single point of contact for multiple clients at a time, helping them better imagine and achieve their goals on the internet.

French, English and Javascript are my native languages.

I can drive over to [                          ] for special occasions, but I work best remotely, so that's what I'm looking for.

Let's have a chat sometime.
